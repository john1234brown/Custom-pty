# Modifications to the app include
- Currently Nothing
- Plan to eventually learn Go enough to implement sanitizer on the pty to bring it back as well!

## What is PTY?

</div>



tty = "teletype"，pty = "pseudo-teletype"

In UNIX, /dev/tty\* is any device that acts like a "teletype"

A pty is a pseudotty, a device entry that acts like a terminal to the process reading and writing there,
but is managed by something else.
They first appeared for X Window and screen and the like,
where you needed something that acted like a terminal but could be used from another program.

<br />

## Quickstart

Start a PTY and set window size.

- Note: -cmd receives an array, and the parameters of the command are passed in the form of an array and needs to be serialized, such as：`[\"java\",\"-jar\",\"ser.jar\",\"nogui\"]`

```bash
go build
./pty -dir "." -cmd [\"bash\"] -size 50,50
```

You can execute any command, just like the SSH terminal.

```
ping google.com
top
htop
```

<br />

## Flags:

```
  -cmd string
        command
  -coder string
        Coder (default "UTF-8")
  -color
        colorable (default false)
  -dir string
        command work path (default ".")
  -size string
        Initialize pty size, stdin will be forwarded directly (default "50,50")
  -test
        Test whether the system environment is pty compatible
```

## MCSManager

MCSManager is a Distributed, Docker-supported, Multilingual, and Lightweight control panel for Minecraft server and all console programs.

This application will provide PTY functionality for MCSManager,
it is specifically designed for MCSManager,
you can also try porting to your own application.
